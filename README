Cloudstore / Release

Kabeer Cloudstore, also known as Cloudstore, 
is a powerful real-time database engine that 
can be used in web applications, 
mobile applications, and self-hosted environments. 
It provides similar functionality to Firebase Firestore, 
with real-time updates, scalability, and a 
flexible API for accessing data. However, 
Cloudstore includes additional features 
that make it stand out, such as a powerful 
database rules engine based on 
CSEL (Cloud Store Expression Language).
